## Detailed Gameplay

**CrazyRubic** is about careful timing, quick reflexes, and on-the-fly decision-making. As you move forward across dangerous terrain, lava rises, and new waves of enemies appear.

### Combo System

Each monster you defeat increases your combo meter. String together multiple monster kills without getting hit to unlock special streak rewards—like bonus coins or short bursts of invincibility.

### Level Progression

- **Obstacle Count:** Each obstacle destroyed ramps up the difficulty.  
- **Monster Slay Rewards:** Slaying monsters quickly can trigger big coin multipliers.  
- **Adaptive Speed:** As you survive longer, your hero speeds up and lava obstacles multiply.

### Randomized Hazards

Watch out for chasing meteors, lava pits, and spinning fire. No two runs are alike!

---

## How to Play

1. **Tap & Hold:** Spin your CrazyRubic hero.  
2. **Dodge Obstacles:** Keep clear of lava blocks, meteor storms, and unpredictable flames.  
3. **Collect Boosts:** Power-ups grant speed bursts or invincibility.  
4. **Climb Leaderboards:** Survive longer, defeat monsters, and chase those high scores!
